MAMSI is a Python framework designed for integration of multi-assay mass spectrometry datasets. 
In addition, the MAMSI framework provides a platform for linking statistically significant features of untargeted multi-assay liquid chromatography â€“ mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics datasets into clusters defined by their structural properties based on mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and retention time (RT).

*N.B. the framework was tested on metabolomics phenotyping data, but it be usable with other types of LC-MS data.*

# Features
- Data integration analysis using the Multi-block Partial Least Squares (MB-PLS) algorithm.
- Multi-block variable importance in projection (MB-VIP).
- Estimation of statistically significant features (variables) using MB-VIP and permutation testing.
- Linking significant features into clusters defined by structural properties of metabolites.
- Feature network links.
- Annotation of untargeted LC-MS features (Only supported for assays analysed by the National Phenome Centre).
