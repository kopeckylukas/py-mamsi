MAMSI is a Python framework designed for integration of multi-assay mass spectrometry datasets. 
In addition, the MAMSI framework provides a platform for linking statistically significant features of untargeted multi-assay liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics datasets into clusters defined by their structural properties based on mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and retention time (RT).

*N.B. the framework was tested on metabolomics phenotyping data, but it be usable with other types of LC-MS data.*

# Features
- Data integration analysis using the Multi-block Partial Least Squares (MB-PLS) algorithm.
- Multi-block variable importance in projection (MB-VIP).
- Estimation of statistically significant features (variables) using MB-VIP and permutation testing.
- Linking significant features into clusters defined by structural properties of metabolites.
- Feature network links.
- Annotation of untargeted LC-MS features (Only supported for assays analysed by the National Phenome Centre).

# Installation 
## Dependencies
- mbpls==1.0.4
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn

## User Installation 
You can install MAMSI from source code code given you have installed both Python (>=3.9) and PIP.

First, clone the repository from GitHub to your computer. You can use following commands if you have a version of Git installed to your computer:

```bash
git https://github.com/kopeckylukas/py-mamsi

cd py-mamsi
```

When you are in project folder, type following code to install MAMSI and all dependencies: 
```bahs
pip install .
```

**Alternatively**, you can install dependencies using pip and MAMSI suing Python:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py develop
```

# Quickstart
You can find all MAMSI tutorials by visiting our [MAMSI Tutorials](https://github.com/kopeckylukas/py-mamsi-tutorials) repository or follow this quickstart guide.

**Load Packages**
```python 
from mamsi.mamsi_pls import MamsiPls
from mamsi.mamsi_struct_search import MamsiStructSearch
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

**Load Sample Data** 
<br> Data used within this quickstart guide originate from the the [AddNeuroMed](https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05064.x) (S. Lovestone *et. al* 2009, Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci.) cohort - dataset of Alzheimer's disease patients. 
You can download the sample data from this [link](https://github.com/kopeckylukas/py-mamsi-tutorials/tree/main/sample_data).


```python
metadata = pd.read_csv('../sample_data/alz_metadata.csv')
# The PLS algorithm requires the response variable to be numeric. 
# We will encode the outcome "Gender" (Biological Sex) as 1 for female and 0 for male subjects. 
y = metadata["Gender"].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'Female' else 0)

# Import LC-MS data
# Add prefix to the columns names. This will be crucial for interpreting the results later on.
hpos = pd.read_csv('./sample_data/alz_hpos.csv').add_prefix('HPOS_')
lpos = pd.read_csv('./sample_data/alz_lpos.csv').add_prefix('LPOS_')
lneg = pd.read_csv('./sample_data/alz_lneg.csv').add_prefix('LNEG_')
```

**Fit MB-PLS Model and Estimate LVs**
```python 
mamsipls = MamsiPls(n_components=1)
mamsipls.fit([hpos, lpos, lneg], y_train)

mamsipls.estimate_lv([hpos, lpos, lneg], y_train, metric='auc')
```

**Estimate Feature Importance**
<br> You can visualise the Multiblock Variable Importance in Projection (MB-VIP):
```python
mb_vip = mamsipls.mb_vip(plot=True)
```
or estimate empirical p-values for all features: 

```python
p_vals, null_vip = mamsipls.mb_vip_permtest([hpos, lpos, lneg], y, n_permutations=10000, return_scores=True)
```

**Interpret Statistically Significant Features**
```python
x = pd.concat([hpos, lpos, lneg], axis=1)

mask = np.where(p_vals < 0.01)
selected = x.iloc[:, mask[0]]
```
Use `MamsiStrustSearch` to search for structural links within the statistically significant features. <br>
Firstly, all features are split into retention time (*RT*) windows of 5 seconds intervals, then each RT window is searched for isotopologue signature’s by searching mass differences of 1.00335 *Da* between mass-to-charge ratios (*m/z*) of the features; if two or more features resemble mass isotopologue signature then they are grouped together. This is followed by a search for common adduct signatures. This is achieved by calculating hypothetical neutral masses based on common adducts in electrospray ionisation. If hypothetical neutral masses match for two or more features within a pre-defined tolerance (15 *ppm*) then these features are grouped together. Overlapping adduct clusters and isotopologues clusters are then merged to form structural clusters. Further, we search cross-assay clusters using [M+H]<sup>+</sup>/[M-H]<sup>-</sup> as link references. Additionally, our structural search tool, that utilises region of interest [(ROI) files](https://github.com/phenomecentre/npc-open-lcms) from [peakPantheR](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/37/24/4886/6298587), allows for automated annotation of  some features based on the *RT* for a given chromatography and m/z.
   
```python
struct = MamsiStructSearch(rt_win=5, ppm=10)
struct.load_lcms(selected)
struct.get_structural_clusters(annotate=True)
```
Further, use can find correlation clusters
```python
struct.get_correlation_clusters(flat_method='silhouette', max_clusters=11)
```
Finally, we visualise the structural relationships using a network plot. The different node colours represent different flattened hierarchical correlation clusters, while the edges between nodes identify their structural links. You can also save the network as an NX object and review in Cytoscape to get better insight on what these the structural relationship between individual features are (e.g. adduct links, isotopologues, cross-assay links).
```python
network = struct.get_structural_network(include_all=True, interactive=False, labels=True, return_nx_object=True)
```
