```

---
Clusters features based on their correlations. The method uses hierarchical clustering to create clusters.
To flatten clusters, the method uses either a constant threshold or silhouette score.


**Args**

* Flattens clusters based on a constant threshold (cut_threshold).
    - 'silhouette': Flattens clusters based on most optimal silhouette score.
    Defaults to 'constant'.
* **cut_threshold** (float, optional) : Constant threshold for flattening clusters. Defaults to 0.7.

* **cor_method** (str {'pearson', 'kendall', 'spearman'}, optional) : Method for calculation correlations. Defaults to 'pearson'.
* **linkage_method** (str, optional) : The linkage criterion determines which distance to use between sets of observation.
    The algorithm will merge the pairs of cluster that minimise this criterion.
    - 'single': Single linkage minimises the maximum distance between observations of pairs of clusters.
    - 'complete': Complete linkage minimises the maximum distance between observations of pairs of clusters.
    - 'average': Average linkage minimises the average of the distances between all observations of pairs of clusters.
    - 'ward': Ward minimises the variance of the clusters being merged.
    - 'weighted': Weighted linkage minimises the sum of the product of the distances and the number of observations in pairs of clusters.
        Only available for 'constant' flatting method.
    - 'centroid': Centroid linkage minimises the distance between the centroids of clusters.
        Only available for 'constant' flatting method.
    - 'median': Median linkage minimises the distance between the medians of clusters.
        Only available for 'constant' flatting method.
    Defaults to 'complete'.
* **metric** (str, optional) : The distance metric to use. The metric to use when calculating distance between instances in a feature array.
    Metric used to compute the linkage. Can be “euclidean”, “l1”, “l2”, “manhattan”, “cosine”, or “precomputed”.
    If linkage is “ward”, only “euclidean” is accepted. If “precomputed”, a distance matrix is needed as input for the fit method.
    Defaults to 'euclidean'.
flat_method (str {'constant', 'silhouette'}, optional):
    Method for cluster flattening:

Generates a structural network graph based on the provided master file or the loaded structural links data.
The method creates a network graph based on the generated structural data or the provided master file.
The network graph includes nodes representing features and edges representing different types of links.

    Defaults to False.

    Defaults to False.
* **output_file** (str, optional) : The name of the output file when displaying the network graph interactively using pyvis.network.

    Defaults to 'interactive.html'.

    Only applicable when interactive is False. 
    Defaults to False.

    This is intended for cases when structural links required manual curation (e.g. manually assigned isotopologue groups, adduct groups, etc.)

    - 'Assay': Assay name (e.g. HPOS). Required.
    - 'Isotopologue group': Grouped features with similar isotopologue patterns (e.g. 1, 2 ... N). Required.
    - 'Isotopologue pattern': Representing M+0, M+1, M+2 ... M+N for each isotopologue group (e.g. 0, 1, 2 ... N). Required.
    - 'Adduct group': Grouped features with similar adduct patterns (e.g. 1, 2 ... N). Required.
    - 'Adduct': Assigned adduct labels to all features within an adduct group (e.g. [M+H]+, [M-H]-). Required.
    - 'Structural cluster': Grouped features based on the intersection of isotopologue and adduct clusters (e.g. 1, 2, 3 ... N). Required.
    - 'Correlation cluster': Grouped flattened correlation clusters (e.g. 1, 2, 3 ... N). Required.
    - 'Cross-assay link': Linked structural clusters between different assays. Required.

    Defaults to None.


**Returns**

* **None**  : The NetworkX object representing the network graph, if return_nx_object is True.
    Edge weights represent the type of link between features:
    - Isotopologue: 1

    - Cross-assay link: 10
    Otherwise, None.

* **RuntimeWarning**  : If no data is loaded and no master file is provided.
* **RuntimeWarning**  : If the provided master file is missing necessary columns.
