**Args**

* Flattens clusters based on a constant threshold (cut_threshold).
    - 'silhouette': Flattens clusters based on most optimal silhouette score.
    Defaults to 'constant'.
* **cut_threshold** (float, optional) : Constant threshold for flattening clusters. Defaults to 0.7.

    The algorithm will merge the pairs of cluster that minimize this criterion.

    - 'average': Average linkage minimises the average of the distances between all observations of pairs of clusters.
    - 'ward': Ward minimises the variance of the clusters being merged.

        Only available for 'constant' flatting method.
    - 'centroid': Centroid linkage minimises the distance between the centroids of clusters.
        Only available for 'constant' flatting method.

        Only available for 'constant' flatting method.
    Defaults to 'complete'.

        - Feature: Feature ID (e.g. HPOS_233.25_149.111m/z)
        - Assay: Assay name (e.g. HPOS)

        - Isotopologue pattern (e.g. 0, 1, 2 ... N representing M+0, M+1, M+2 ... M+N)
        - Adduct group (groups features with similar adduct patterns)
        - Adduct (adduct label, e.g. [M+H]+, [M-H]-)

        - Cross-assay link (links features across different assays)
        - cpdName (compound name, optional)
    Defaults to None.


**Returns**

* **None**  : The NetworkX object representing the network graph, if return_nx_object is True.

    Otherwise, None.
                        


**Raises**

* **RuntimeWarning**  : If the provided master file is missing necessary columns.

Notes:
    - The function creates a network graph based on the provided master file or the loaded structural links data.
    - The network graph includes nodes representing features and edges representing different types of links.
    - The graph can be displayed interactively using pyvis.network or using networkx and matplotlib.
    - The graph can be saved as a NetworkX object if return_nx_object is True.
