The MAMSI workflow utilises a multi-block partial-least squares (MB-PLS) discriminant analysis algorithm, which allows for the integration of multiple assays and the subsequent identification of the most significant predictors (features). The identification of statistically significant predictors is done using a multi-block version of the variable importance in projection (MB-VIP) procedure coupled with permutation testing. This enables us to obtain empirical p-values for each feature across all assays. MAMSI also offers an easy interpretation of significant features. This is done by grouping of the significant features based on their structural properties (mass-to-charge ratio and retention time) and compared to their correlations. This can be visualised by a network plot.</p> <p>This notebook showcases the use of the MAMSI workflow for the prediction (classification) of the biological sex of patients within the AddNeuroMed cohort [3] - dataset of Alzheimer's disease patients.
